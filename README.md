# Dark Avenue Photography Site

[Live Site](www.darkavenuephotography.com)

This is the repo for the darkavenuephotography.com website. This site is a simple photoblog built with Gridsome. The content is being fetched from Wordpress, to take advantage of an easy-to-use CMS to uploading photos and categorizing and sorting. It makes use of the JAMstack plugin in Wordpress to rebuild this static site on Netlify whenever an image is posted or removed.
